Quick is a customizable comparison tool that calculates and displays side by side differences between two flat files in an easy to read format.

Quick's Customizations options include:
 * selecting which rows and columns to use during the comparison.
 * selecting which columns values are case-sensitive.
 * selecting which columns values contain leading and trailing white space.
 * matching columns values with regular expressions.
 * ignoring row order

Side by side differences are orgnized in a table containing the labels, the positions and the column values of each file.
